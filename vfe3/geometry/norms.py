r"""Normalization registry for VFE_3.0 belief means.

The gauge-pure options are ``none`` (identity, trivially equivariant) and ``mahalanobis``.
MahalanobisNorm rescales mu by the gauge-invariant Mahalanobis length:
    mu_norm = mu * sqrt(K / (mu^T Sigma^-1 mu + eps)).
Since mu^T Sigma^-1 mu is invariant under mu->g mu, Sigma->g Sigma g^T, the scale is
gauge-invariant and mu_norm transforms as a vector. Pure math, no parameters.

``layernorm`` is an OPT-IN, NON-gauge-equivariant baseline: standard transformer LayerNorm
standardization of the mean over the belief dimension (see LayerNorm). With ``layernorm_affine=True``
the builder returns the AffineLayerNorm variant, which adds a learned per-feature affine (gamma/beta)
on top of the standardization -- a SANCTIONED learned-scalar exception (t5_bias / learnable_kappa
family), still non-equivariant. Both are ablations / baselines against the gauge-pure paths, which
remain ``none``/``mahalanobis``.

    The Mahalanobis scalar ``s2 = mu^T Sigma^-1 mu`` is gauge-invariant under the FULL-covariance
    congruence: with mu->g mu, Sigma->g Sigma g^T it maps to
    ``mu^T g^T (g Sigma g^T)^-1 g mu = mu^T Sigma^-1 mu``. The exact SPD solve is evaluated in a
    float64 island, so the scale ``sqrt(K/s2)`` is invariant up to storage precision and ``mu_norm``
    transforms as a vector. If exact factorization fails, an explicitly approximate regularized
    Cholesky/pseudo-inverse fallback keeps the forward finite; that fallback is not gauge-invariant
    because an isotropic ridge does not transform by congruence. The DIAGONAL branch
    (``sum(mu^2 / sigma)``) is the Mahalanobis form only for a diagonal Sigma: it is invariant under
    the diagonal-scaling subgroup, NOT a general non-diagonal g in GL(K) -- consistent with the
    gaussian_diagonal family being declared non-GL(K)-invariant (groups.check_admissible). Pure math,
    no parameters.

    exactly ``torch.nn.LayerNorm(K, elementwise_affine=True)`` on the belief MEAN (``sigma`` ignored).

    SANCTIONED LEARNED-SCALAR EXCEPTION (t5_bias / learnable_kappa family, default OFF via

    not an ``nn.Linear`` / MLP / activation, so they carry no hidden network. They are still
    NON-gauge-equivariant -- a per-coordinate affine in the fixed basis does not commute with a
    general g in GL(K); the affine sits on the same non-gauge-pure path LayerNorm already occupies,
    adding a diagonal scale/shift on top of its centering (an opt-in baseline, not a gauge-pure path;
    those remain ``none``/``mahalanobis``). As an ``nn.Module`` its parameters
    register on the owning model and must be placed in an M-step optimizer group (train.build_optimizer
    groups them at ``m_p_mu_lr``, ``weight_decay=0``, ``role='mu'``). When used as the BLOCK norm the
    affine is applied to the belief VALUE inside the stack, so (unlike learnable_kappa, which enters
    only the E-step tangent) it trains under ``'unroll'`` AND ``'straight_through'`` and is frozen
    ONLY by the fully-detached E-step (effective ``'detach'``, which no_grads the whole stack;
    model.__init__ warns). As the FINAL norm it is post-stack and trains under any estimator.
