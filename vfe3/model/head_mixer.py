r"""Schur-commutant head mixer for VFE_3.0 (opt-in).

Without labels (the legacy equal-dims form) mixes ``n`` equal-size gauge-irrep blocks with one
learned matrix :math:`A = I + \Delta \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}` embedded as
:math:`\mathrm{kron}(A, I_d)`, where :math:`n` is the number of blocks and :math:`d` the
(shared) block dimension. With ``irrep_labels`` the class builds one :math:`A_t = I + \Delta_t`
per maximal run of equal-labeled blocks -- the full linear commutant of a mixed-irrep tower for
real-type irreps -- so unequal block dimensions no longer raise a dim-collision hazard provided
they carry different labels. Under ``block_glk`` the blocks are the ``n_heads`` heads, so the
mixer mixes heads. Applied symmetrically to the mean and covariance:

.. math::
    M    = \mathrm{blockdiag}_t(A_t \otimes I_{d_t}) \in \mathbb{R}^{K \times K}, \qquad
    \mu' = M\,\mu, \qquad
    \Sigma' = M\,\Sigma\,M^{\top},

with the diagonal-covariance closed form (the diagonal-of-sandwich approximation already used
throughout V3 when ``diagonal_covariance=True``)

.. math::
    \sigma'[m, c] = \sum_n A_t[m, n]^2\, \sigma[n, c]

applied block-by-block for each component :math:`t`.

Initialization is exactly the identity (:math:`\Delta_t = 0`, stored as the delta-from-identity
so the init is bit-exact), so a model with the mixer enabled is bitwise indistinguishable from
the mixer-disabled path at step 0.

Gauge equivariance: :math:`\mathrm{kron}(A, I_d)` commutes with a block-diagonal gauge
:math:`\mathrm{diag}(h_1, \ldots, h_n)` ONLY when the gauge is TIED (:math:`h_k = h_0` for all
:math:`k`). V3's ``block_glk`` generators (``generate_glk_multihead``) give each head its OWN
independent ``gl(d_head)`` sub-algebra -- an UNTIED gauge -- so the mixer does NOT commute with
the per-head gauge action and breaks strict gauge equivariance there. The deviation is zero at
the identity init and grows as :math:`A` drifts from :math:`I` during training. This is an
accepted, opt-in departure (the no-mixer path is the default and stays equivariant).

The ``tied_block_glk`` group (generators ``kron(I_n, gl(d))``, one shared frame across heads)
restores exact equivariance: under a tied gauge :math:`\Omega = \mathrm{kron}(I_n, h)`,
:math:`M = \mathrm{kron}(A, I_d)` commutes with :math:`\Omega`, so the FULL-COVARIANCE mixer is
exactly equivariant -- :math:`\mathrm{mix}(\Omega\mu, \Omega\Sigma\Omega^\top) = (\Omega M\mu,
\Omega M\Sigma M^\top \Omega^\top)` (pinned by ``test_head_mixer_equivariant_under_tied_gauge_full_cov``).
This is a statement about the MIXER OPERATION, not a claim that the whole model is gauge-equivariant.
CAVEAT: the diagonal closed form :math:`\sigma'[m] = \sum_n A[m,n]^2 \sigma[n]` is equivariant only
under DIAGONAL gauges (the diagonal-of-sandwich approximation V3 already uses when
``diagonal_covariance=True``), not under a general tied gauge.
