r"""Frame-intrinsic Gaussian family for VFE_3.0 (default OFF; opt in via ``family``).

``gaussian_diagonal`` stores a covariance that is diagonal in the FIXED basis. The transport is
a congruence, and diagonal covariance is not closed under a general :math:`\mathrm{GL}(K)`
congruence, so :func:`vfe3.geometry.transport.transport_covariance` forms the sandwich and keeps
only its diagonal. The discarded off-diagonal mass grows with the conditioning of the frames.

This family declares the covariance diagonal in the agent's OWN fiber frame instead,

.. math::
    \Sigma_i = U_i \operatorname{diag}(\sigma_i) U_i^{\top},

which IS closed under the frame action. For the pure Regime-I coboundary
:math:`\Omega_{ij} = U_i U_j^{-1}` the sender frame cancels from the congruence and the receiver
frame cancels from the location,

.. math::
    \Omega_{ij}\Sigma_j\Omega_{ij}^{\top}
        = U_i \operatorname{diag}(\sigma_j) U_i^{\top},
    \qquad
    U_i^{-1}\Omega_{ij}\mu_j = U_j^{-1}\mu_j = a_j,

so, writing :math:`a = U^{-1}\mu` for the frame-intrinsic location and using invariance of a
divergence under a common invertible pushforward, the edge energy is EXACTLY the diagonal
divergence between :math:`(a_i, \sigma_i)` and :math:`(a_j, \sigma_j)`:

.. math::
    D\bigl(q_i \,\|\, \Omega_{ij\#}q_j\bigr)
        = D_{\mathrm{diag}}\bigl((a_i, \sigma_i) \,\|\, (a_j, \sigma_j)\bigr).

Both transports therefore reduce to a broadcast over the query axis, and the pair energy is the
exact full-covariance divergence evaluated at diagonal cost with no sandwich materialized.

CONSEQUENCE, stated plainly: the relative frame :math:`\Omega_{ij}` cancels out of the pair
energy. Under this family the gauge no longer shapes the belief coupling; it acts only through
each agent's own frame-intrinsic location. That is the coboundary triviality of Regime I
(``vfe4_whitepaper/03_bundle_geometry.tex``, ``eq:regime-i-loop-holonomy``) made explicit, and it
is a genuinely DIFFERENT model rather than a numerical refinement of ``gaussian_diagonal``. It is
default OFF for that reason. The parameters stored in the ``mu`` slot are read as the
frame-intrinsic coordinates :math:`a`, not fixed-basis means.

The exact-congruence variant, which removes the same diagonal truncation while keeping the gauge
ACTIVE in the energy (it pulls the query back by :math:`\Omega^{-1}` instead of cancelling the
frame), lives in :mod:`vfe3.families.exact_congruence` as ``family="gaussian_diagonal_exact"``.
