r"""Numerical conditioning fallbacks + runtime monitors for VFE_3.0.

Two concerns, both modular (registry-backed):
  CONDITIONING FALLBACKS keep the SPD-manifold math finite under ill-conditioning:
    safe_spd_inverse (escalating-jitter Cholesky -> pinv), floor_eigenvalues,
    condition_number.
  RUNTIME MONITORS report numerical health during a run (nan/inf fraction, condition
    number, ...) as plain scalars, via a register_monitor registry so a new probe slots
    in without editing call sites. ``run_monitors`` emits a CSV/JSON-friendly record.

A theoretically pure path is always available (the unregularized op); the fallbacks are
guards that activate only when the pure path fails, and they are documented as such.

    Uses ``torch.linalg.cholesky_ex`` (returns a per-batch-element ``info``, does NOT raise)
    so that a single non-PD element cannot kill the whole batched call. Round 0 adds ZERO
    extra jitter, so on already-SPD inputs the returned factor is byte-identical to
    ``torch.linalg.cholesky`` (the pure path). Elements that fail (``info != 0``) are retried
    with an escalating ridge ``eps * 10^t`` for t = 0..rounds-1, applied ONLY to the failed
    elements so good elements keep their round-0 factor unperturbed.

    Returns the factor ``L`` together with a boolean ``ok`` mask (True where a PD factor was
    obtained). Callers MUST drive masking off ``ok`` (not finiteness): on failure ``cholesky_ex``
    returns a finite *partial* factor, not NaN, so a downstream ``logdet`` would otherwise be a
    finite-but-wrong value rather than NaN. The mask lets the caller inject NaN for failed
    elements so a ``safe_kl_clamp`` maps them to ``kl_max``.

    JITTER SCALE (audit 2026-08-06 C3/F18). The ridge is ABSOLUTE by default, which makes its
    meaning depend entirely on where the matrix sits: at an eigenvalue on the ``eps=1e-6`` SPD
    floor the ``t=0`` ridge DOUBLES it and shifts ``logdet`` by exactly ``log 2 = 0.693`` nats per
    floored direction, while at ``sigma_max=100`` the same ridge is a 1e-8 relative no-op and at
    ``sigma_init=4`` it is 2.5e-7. So one ladder is simultaneously an unbounded relative bias where
    it fires and far too weak to be a conditioning signal anywhere else.

    ``jitter_mode="relative"`` scales the ridge by ``diagonal_mean(M)``, giving every element the
    same RELATIVE perturbation. It is opt-in and the default stays ``"absolute"`` so every run on
    disk is bit-reproducible; the two agree exactly when ``diagonal_mean(M) == 1``. Practical
    severity is capped either way because the ladder only ever fires above cond ~1e8 (measured
    3000/3000 repaired at t=0 across cond 1e4..1e12), which is why this is a latent-correctness fix
    rather than a live one.
