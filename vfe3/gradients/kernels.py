r"""Optimized hand-derived belief-gradient kernels for VFE_3.0, with oracle fallback.

A family-keyed registry of analytic (grad_mu, grad_sigma) kernels for the QUERY-SIDE
(filtering) gradient. belief_gradients() uses the registered kernel only for the
filtering + gaussian_diagonal + KL (renyi_order=1) + canonical case; every other case
(smoothing, non-KL family, Renyi alpha != 1, surrogate) FALLS BACK to the autograd
oracle -- so a new divergence works immediately and correctly, accelerated later by
registering a kernel. Kernels return RAW Euclidean dF (no preconditioning/retraction).

    Mirrors ``DecodeRegistration.covariance_kinds`` (``vfe3/model/prior_bank.py``): the route
    predicate (``uses_kernel_route``) gates on a declared capability rather than a family-name
    literal, so registering a new family's closed form is sufficient to unlock the route it
    declares -- and ONLY that route.

    ``covariance_kinds`` is the resolved set of family covariance structures ("diagonal" and/or
    "full") this registration covers, validated against the registered family's OWN ``cov_kind`` at
    registration time (unlike decoders, a kernel is keyed by exact family name, so mismatch is
    always a registration bug, not a legitimate multi-family share -- caught here rather than
    mis-routed later).

    ``provides_gradient`` / ``provides_mm_exact`` are DECOUPLED capabilities (audit 2026-08-07): a
    family may register the analytic ``(grad_mu, grad_sigma)`` kernel ``belief_gradients`` fetches
    through ``callable``, the closed-form MM minimizer ``mm_exact_update`` implements as its own
    dedicated branch, or both. Registering one never silently unlocks the other -- this is why
    ``gaussian_full``'s mm_exact fusion below declares ``provides_gradient=False``: it has no
    analytic gradient kernel, and ``e_step_update='gradient'`` must keep routing to the autograd
    oracle exactly as it did before this registration existed.

    ``lambda_beta`` (1.0 = pure) scales ONLY the belief-coupling (pair) term, not the alpha
    self-term -- the analytic counterpart of scaling the post-softmax coupling+entropy block in
    ``free_energy`` (the envelope identity makes the pair term equal to d/dtheta of that block at
    beta*, so scaling both by the same factor keeps kernel == oracle).

    ``beta`` is the raw attention weight in its COMPACT per-head form. ``pair_mask`` gates only
    destination-energy derivatives: the one-hop derivative uses ``beta * pair_mask``, while the
    two-hop derivative uses ``(beta.detach() @ beta.detach()) * pair_mask``. Thus a zero or
    saturated intermediate edge may still carry hop mass, but a zero or saturated destination
    energy has the same zero derivative as the scalar clamp. For backward-compatible direct kernel
    calls, ``pair_mask=None`` treats ``beta`` as already masked. The coordinate-resolution weight
    beta_ij^(h(k)) is realized inside ``_pair_contract`` by
    contracting the head axis against a head-shaped VIEW of the pair difference, so the
    (..., N, N, K) ``beta_coord`` broadcast the old kernel consumed is never materialized
    (vram audit 2026-06-10: one full B x N^2 x K tensor saved for backward, for free).

    Self-term saturation mask m_i = 1[0 < D(q_i||p_i) < kl_max]: the oracle differentiates through
    safe_kl_clamp(D, [0, kl_max]), whose gradient is 0 once the raw self-divergence saturates the
    clamp, so the hand kernel zeros its self-term there to stay EXACTLY equal to the filtering
    oracle. The pairwise clamp mask is supplied by the caller from the clamped energy grid.

    The mask is shape-driven by ``alpha_coef``: a per-position coefficient (N,1) carries a summed
    self-divergence clamped as one scalar, so the mask is per-token (N,1); a per-coordinate
    coefficient (N,K) (the ``state_dependent_per_coord`` form) carries a coordinate-wise clamp, so
    the mask is per-coordinate (N,K) and a saturated coordinate is gated WITHOUT killing its
    unsaturated neighbors. The two coincide at K=1.

    ``provides_mm_exact``. The two are independent: registering ONE never silently unlocks the
    other, so a family that adds an mm_exact closed form without an analytic gradient kernel (e.g.
    ``gaussian_full``) cannot redirect ``e_step_update='gradient'`` onto an unvalidated path.

    A registration that declares ``needs_mu`` or ``needs_sigma`` excludes both routes (audit
    2026-06-10 F1): a frozen-transport closed form treats transported keys as constants in the
    belief variables, so it would silently omit the derivative of a belief-dependent transport.
    Such registrations route to the autograd oracle, which rebuilds Omega from its differentiation
    leaves through ``omega_builder``.

    ``decoupled_value_gauge`` (RopeTransport.on_value=False) likewise excludes both routes: with the
    attention gauge and value gauge factored apart (GL(K)_attention.tex:1909), beta is the softmax of
    the rotated SCORE energy but the coupling sum uses the un-rotated value energy, so beta is no
    longer that sum's stationary point and the closed-form envelope (which assumes it is) does
    not apply. The oracle differentiates the decoupled F directly and carries the extra d beta/d mu
    term."""

        Sigma*       =  (a_i + Sum_j w_ij) Lambda*^{-1},

    i.e. the diagonal kernel's scalar ``1/sigma`` divisions become d x d Cholesky-based precisions
    and solves (never an explicit ``torch.linalg.inv``). Per-pair precisions are built with
    ``FullGaussian.mean_fisher_precision`` -- the SAME Cholesky-then-``cholesky_inverse`` route (with
    the SAME ``pinv`` degenerate-factorization fallback) the rest of the full-covariance code already
    uses for "get a precision from a covariance" (``natural_gradient``'s preconditioner, the
    diagnostics in ``metrics.py``), rather than a new convention.

    d is EITHER the full K (the single-irrep-block route, ``w`` shape ``(..., N, N)``) OR one gauge
    head's own ``d_head`` (the multi-head per-block route, called once per head by
    ``_mm_exact_full_covariance`` with every tensor already sliced to that head's coordinates and
    that head's OWN pair weight ``w_ij^(h)``) -- this function has no irrep concept at all, so both
    callers share one implementation and one set of numerics.

    Reused Choleskys: unlike the diagonal branch (whose ``pair_stats`` hoist can share graph-live
    diagonal-KL statistics with ``belief_gradients``), this fusion factors ``sigma_p``/``sigma_t``
    FRESH rather than threading the factor ``FullGaussian.renyi_closed_form`` already computed while
    scoring the self/pair energy above -- the existing factor lives inside a private helper
    (``_full_gaussian_kl_terms``) with three OTHER callers, and reaching into it here would either
    change that shared helper's signature (a wider, riskier edit) or duplicate its algebra. Correct,
    not maximally efficient; a documented opportunity, not a defect.

    r"""K x K precision-fusion minimizer for a full-covariance family (WAVE4 audit derivation).

    SINGLE IRREP BLOCK (``irrep_dims`` None or length 1): the dense ``_mm_exact_dense_fusion`` runs
    directly on the whole K.

    MULTI-HEAD (length > 1, e.g. ``gauge_group='block_glk'``): PROVEN exact whenever ``sigma_p`` is
    block-diagonal (2026-08-07 gauge-audit reversal of the earlier blanket ValueError here -- the
    original probe used a DENSE random ``sigma_p``, an input the live encode path never produces;
    measured on the CORRECT construction, ``torch.diag_embed`` as ``prior_bank._encode_prior_sigma``
    builds it, the cross-block ``grad_sigma`` is exactly 0.0 across 6 seeds and H in {2, 3}).
    Derivation: ``FullGaussian.coupling_energy`` scores each head h off ONLY its own diagonal
    K_h x K_h submatrix of Sigma (``.block()``), so as a function of the FULL dense Sigma_i the
    coupling term has EXACTLY ZERO partial derivative with respect to any off-block entry, for every
    Sigma_i (not just a block-diagonal one -- verified: perturbing a dense, non-block-diagonal
    Sigma's off-block entries left grad_sigma's cross-block components matching
    ``-0.5 a (Sigma^{-1})^{(h,h')}`` from the SELF term alone, to the last float). So the total
    gradient's off-block component is exactly ``0.5 a (Sigma_p^{-1} - Sigma*^{-1})^{(h,h')}``; zeroing
    it forces ``(Sigma*^{-1})^{(h,h')} = (Sigma_p^{-1})^{(h,h')} = 0`` whenever Sigma_p is
    block-diagonal (an SPD matrix's inverse is block-diagonal under a partition iff the matrix
    itself is), hence Sigma* itself is exactly block-diagonal, and each diagonal block's own
    stationarity equation is the per-head fusion below -- an EXACT decomposition, not an ansatz.
    ``w`` already carries the per-head axis here (``pairwise_energy(..., irrep_dims=...)`` returns
    ``(..., H, N, N)`` for H > 1, unconditionally), so each head keeps its OWN pair weight w_ij^(h);
    the outer preamble does not need to (and does not) collapse it to one shared weight.

    Any group whose Sigma is genuinely NOT block-diagonal (``prior_source='model_channel'``'s packed
    Cholesky covariance, per the gauge audit) fails the EXECUTED ``_verify_prior_block_diagonal``
    check below rather than silently fusing the wrong objective.
